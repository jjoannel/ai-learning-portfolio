# Retail Sales Forecast

## Overview

This project simulates a multi-store beauty retailer and builds an end-to-end
retail analytics pipeline to forecast future product demand.

The project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow:

- Data Modeling
- Synthetic Data Generation
- Data Validation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Forecasting
- Business Insights

---

## Business Problem

Retailers need accurate sales forecasts to:

- Improve inventory planning
- Reduce stockouts
- Prevent overstock
- Optimize promotions
- Improve store replenishment

This project predicts future daily product sales across multiple retail stores.

---

## Objectives

- Design a retail star schema
- Generate realistic retail sales data
- Analyze historical sales behavior
- Engineer forecasting features
- Train machine learning forecasting models
- Evaluate model performance

---

## Tech Stack

### Languages

- Python
- SQL

### Libraries

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib

### Tools

- Jupyter Notebook
- Git
- GitHub

## Data Model
* [Data Dictionary](./docs/data_dictionary.md)
* [Data Model Decisions](./docs/data_model_decisions.md)

The project uses a star schema consisting of:

Dimension Tables
- dim_calendar
- dim_product
- dim_store
- dim_promotion
- dim_service

Bridge Tables
- bridge_product_promotion
- bridge_product_component
- bridge_store_service

Fact Tables
- fact_store_sales
- fact_service_sales

(Insert ER Diagram Here)

## Data Simulations and Assumptions

* Simulation for Door Tier
1) Each store gets randomly labeled Flagship, A, B, or C
2) Based on that label, the store is told how big it is (Flagship = large sqft)
3) Based on that same label, the store is told how much it sells (Flagship = sells more) The demand multiplier is: Flagship sells 3.2x, A sells 1.8x, B	sells 1.0x (baseline), C	sells 0.55x
